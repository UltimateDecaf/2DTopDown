This game is created based on Nathan Farrer's Unity Multiplayer course on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-multiplayer-netcode/

 My contribution is that instead of the PvP, I created a co-op game where players compete against swarms of enemies. 
Hence, all the logic around enemies (spawning, their movement, damage) and scores (with leaderboard that can be toggled) are made by me.
Also, the course had tanks as avatar, and the movement needed to be adjusted for a humanoid cyborg.
These changes also needed to account for client-server architecture.
